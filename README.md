# ME193-Project3
# Solving ODE: Damping Oscillator 

I am currently taking ME31 and we have been learning a lot about transfer functions, ODEs, and various classic second order systems. For this project I decided to go with a classic second order damped harmonic oscillator. Looking in the future I would like to tackle a more complex ODE that takes more time to solve and requires more constraints, but I don't have the knowlege or means to solve one at this moment. I plan to come back to this project in the near future.
